# general-offensive-1975-project

## 📖 Introduction
**general-offensive-1975-project** is a **C++ project** demonstrating fundamental **data structures and algorithms**, inspired by the **Spring 1975 General Offensive and Uprising**, marking Vietnam’s **Reunification Day (April 30th)**.  
This project is developed to commemorate the **50th anniversary (1975–2025)**, also known as **A50**.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Implementation of key **data structures** (linked list, stack, queue, tree, graph, etc.).  
- Demonstration of **classic algorithms** (sorting, searching, traversal, etc.).  
- Historical theme connecting computer science with the **spirit of 1975**.  

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
- **C++17 or newer**  
- A C++ compiler such as:
  - GCC / G++  
  - MSVC  
  - Clang  

---

## ▶️ How to Run
After compiling the project, you can run it with:

```bash
.\run.bat
or directly:

bash
Copy code
.\main
📊 Expected Output
When running the program, the output will demonstrate:

Execution results of selected algorithms.

Step-by-step visualization of data structure operations.

A symbolic message linking algorithms to the historical significance of April 30th, 1975.

(You can add screenshots or example outputs here later for clarity.)
